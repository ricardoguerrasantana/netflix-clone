In this is project you are going to find an application built with React, Firebase and Styled Components. It uses React Router to handle pages, Context to handle state and Custom Hooks to retrieve data from Firebase Firestore. The project follows the tutorial made by Karl Hadwen (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_EEwGe-a9o)
Thanks Karl for spreading the knowledge.
